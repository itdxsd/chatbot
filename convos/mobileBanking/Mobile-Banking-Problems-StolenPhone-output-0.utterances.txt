What will happen if my Mobile phone was lost or stolen, do I need to re-enroll again?
You donâ€™t have to re-enroll again if you will still use the same mobile number on a new phone.  

However, if you will have a new mobile number, you need to inform your maintaining branch to update your bank records before you download the app on your new phone.
