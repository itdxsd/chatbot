Can I transfer funds from my peso account to my dollar account and vice-versa for Mobile Phone Banking?
Fund transfers can only be done between accounts having the same currency, that is, Peso to Peso transfers only.  

For Dollar accounts, fund transfer can only be posted on account with the same currency and maintained at the same branch, and available only during banking days from 6:00 am to 10: 00 pm.
