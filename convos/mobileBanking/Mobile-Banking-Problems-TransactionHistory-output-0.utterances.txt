How come I cannot view all of my previous transactions or transaction history in the UCPB Mobile Banking App?
The Transaction History feature of your UCPB Mobile Banking app only shows transactions initiated through the mobile app. 

The complete transaction history may be viewed by logging in UCPB Connect.
