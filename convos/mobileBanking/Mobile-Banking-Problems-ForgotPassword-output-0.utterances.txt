What if I forget my Password in Mobile Phone Banking?
Your maintaining branch will require you to submit a signed letter of request which indicates your username, contact details and copy of two photo-bearing IDs. 

Once processed, you will receive a system generated temporary password in your registered email address in UCPB Connect. 

Once you have accessed and changed your password in UCPB Connect, you can now then access your Mobile Phone Banking.
